# VMETA - Vanessa Meta
Hi guys, this is another ai assistant developed after the successful Vanessa Gemini.
This time I've chosen to use an open source generative AI instead of Gemini based in Google Cloud. The model uses a LLama3 model developed by Meta (for this reason, the bot is called Vanessa Meta);
I will soon publish another youtube video to show the capabilities of this system.
For now I'll put here some contextual photos.
